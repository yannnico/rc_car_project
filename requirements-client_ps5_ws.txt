# Minimal requirements to run only the client at src/client/client_ps5_ws.py
# This is a slim subset of the repo's full requirements.
# Install with: python -m pip install -r requirements-client_ps5_ws.txt

# Runtime packages
pygame==2.6.1
websockets==12.0

# Notes:
# - This client uses the local module src/client/car_control.py (no extra packages).
# - These are the Python wrapper packages. The system must have appropriate
#   drivers for your joystick/gamepad (OS-specific).
# - No system-level native libraries are required for this client alone.
